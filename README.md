# Healthcare Insurance Company Data Pipeline

### WHAT: 
Our project is focused on creating a data pipeline for healthcare companies that receive large amounts of data on a daily basis. This data will need to be readily available for senior management to read and take action upon. 

### WHY: 
Due to the large amounts of data available to health insurance companies, they need to extract and transform data in order to make business decisions for their bottom line. Health insurance companies look at a myriad of factors such as a person’s age, smoking habits, alcohol intake, and overall general health before offering insurance to the applicant. By creating a data pipeline, company can easily analyze the data and decide whether to offer which groups of people insurance and at what premium. Other factors include reimbursement amount and inpatient deductible that increase the healthcare insurance company’s bottom line.

### How:

Build a data pipeline. 

We aim to source data obtained from the insurance company itself, extract the data, perform data cleanup, and loaded into a database. 
From there, we will create buckets of categories such as member age, gender, and sample of diseases. This will help us quantify categorical variables.
Lastly, we will create visualizations that will help translate large swaths of data into informative graphs that senior management can utilize to make actionable recommendations.
